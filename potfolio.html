      <h3>Project 1</h3>
      <p>This image is a clean, professional brand header for Adesola Adebayo,<br> also known as Solax001. <br>It effectively communicates their dual role as a Web Developer and UI/UX Designer with a clear call-to-action button. <br> The minimalist design focuses attention on their name, title, <br> and the opportunity to view their portfolio.

      <h3>Project 2</h3>
      <p>This is a screenshot of a casual, professional chat conversation between Adesola Adebayo and a colleague about the "Solex001" project. <br> The discussion confirms that the new branding, specifically a purple gradient logo, has been successfully implemented into the dashboard. <br> The online status and use of "our" logo suggest Adesola is part of a team actively collaborating on the design.</p>

      <img src="ATM card done (1).PNG" alt="Project 3">
      <h3>Project 3</h3>
      <p>This image is a mockup or concept design for a "Solex001" branded debit card issued by First Bank of Nigeria. <br> It features a placeholder card number, the cardholder name "Adesola Adebayo," and all the standard security features and bank information found on a real financial card. <br> The inclusion of the "Activate Windows" notice at the bottom confirms this is a digital design or screenshot rather than a photo of a physical, issued bank card.</p>
